# MTFP DNRC Data History

1. This repo pulls data from MT DNRC's [Interactive Fire Map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6bea18851bec440d9260cb0d28f53281/)
2. Allows for caching of data via GitHub Actions a few times per hour rather than hitting the service we are using data every time a user visits
3. Background [Git Scraping Basics - Simon Willson](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/)
